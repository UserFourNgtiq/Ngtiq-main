                <p>Custom software and custom application development consist of designing, creating, deploying, and
                    maintaining applications tailored for a specific set of users, functions, or organizations.</p>

                <p>These applications are also designed to serve a particular set of needs – for example, a manufacturer
                    might want a field service equipment maintenance app, or a healthcare system might be looking to
                    build a health and fitness web and mobile application for their patients to use.</p>

        <div class="row">

                <p>Custom applications automate repetitive tasks – such as data movement and managing workflows – to
                    save time and accelerate productivity. With custom applications, organizations can save on investing
                    in multiple applications and reduce the risks from external threats. Moreover, custom applications
                    are cost-effective, agile, and highly efficient.</p>

                <p>Custom applications can be taken to the market where they are sold as SaaS products that generate
                    revenue. In this way they serve two purposes: your immediate needs, and revenue generation. Done
                    right, a custom application can end up paying for itself in this way.</p>

                <p>There is no such thing as perfect software. No matter what configuration you choose while buying
                    software off-the-shelf, there will probably always be inefficiencies, a lack of specific features
                    that your business requires, and/or the need for some data manipulation to connect your software
                    stack.</p>

                <p>All of this can have a negative impact on ROI. It doesn’t have to be this way, though.</p>

                            not just fixing defects but also modifying the entire application to improve performance.
                            Our process involves a thorough study of the existing applications to identify improvement
                            areas and offer customized solutions.</p>

                <p>Ngtiq leverages an “Agile + Design Thinking” based methodology to provide a structured process that
                    encourages creative problem-solving. It also reduces the time between development and deployment
                    while increasing product quality and team productivity.</p>
                <p>Our overall process involves gathering requirements, talking to the users, arriving at an analysis
                    after thorough research, executing the journey- or process-mapping, performing a technology
                    capability assessment, and deploying a rigorous and tested design process.</p>
                <p>We develop a proof of concept and get early user feedback so we can make any necessary changes
                    earlier in the journey. After adjusting the design, we deliver and maintain the application, which
                    is built to meet your specific needs.</p>
                <h5 class="text-center mb-5">Custom Application Building Approach</h5>
                <img src="image/methodology.jpg" alt="methodology" class="w-100">
                <p class="text-center mt-3">Copyright © 2023 Ngtiq</p>
                <p>In addition to the actual building of the application, our process includes collaborative exercises,
                    sharing of data-driven insights, ideation, prototyping and testing, utilizing user stories to create
                    design experiences, and conducting user testing and acceptance. We also provide post-launch support
                    with our 24x7, custom software and application management teams.</p>
                <p>Our application building approach involves a combination of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Microservices Architecture</h5>
                    </li>
                    <p>Microservices are single-function applications made of small, self-contained units that work
                        together through language-independent application programming interfaces (APIs). Microservices
                        architecture is comparatively faster and more agile than a traditional application architecture.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <h5> Containerization and Pods</h5>
                    </li>
                    <p>Containers are separate workload environments in a virtualized operating system, whereas a pod is
                        a group of one or more containers with shared storage/network resources. Containers house the
                        resources apps need to run, and they are portable across operating systems. They also speed up
                        workload processes and application delivery, and they create a flexible, scalable deployment
                        pipeline that enables automation of releases and upgrades.</p>

                <p>By teaming with a custom application development services provider, you can conduct a thorough
                    evaluation to uncover your software needs and build and deploy an application tailored to your
                    specific requirements – resulting in improved efficiency, as well as savings when it comes to time,
