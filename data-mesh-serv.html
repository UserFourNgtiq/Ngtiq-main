                    Experimentation. Utilizing data federation, business personas have immediate access to data to
                    explore, understand, and gain insight. This stage connects multiple separate data siloes together to
                    create a single panel of glass to said data.

                <p class="para-style">
                    Stage 1 is characterized by data utilization, but a lack of data exploitation. The business uses
                    data as-is within its silo but lacks the ability to identify insights across domains to extract
                    additional insight and value. Analytics is ad-hoc due to siloed data architecture, creating barriers
                    to insight generation. Visibility of data meaning (single source of truth) due to limited data
                    governance capabilities leads to data trust challenges.

                    Typically, the data strategy for each silo is owned and developed by IT with input from business
                    stakeholders. It is more difficult for a true business-focused data approach, as each silo has
                    different governance rules and access methods aligned with their needs. This results in
                    organizational and cultural barriers to data access and insight generation.

                <p class="para-style">
                    At Stage 2, businesses must start to experiment with the elements of data ownership, where the silo
                    is responsible or “owns” that data. In other words, it is responsible for the quality, security,
                    governance, consistency, and availability of data within its domain.

                    At this stage, the business begins to understand that the data strategy is critical to its business
                    strategy, and therefore starts to take more ownership of that strategy. To support such strategies,
                    data agility becomes a critical focus. To support such agility, data connection and sharing across
                    domains becomes imperative. However, this stage still involves centralized control, with centralized
                    teams performing a majority of the activities around data operations.

                    capabilities, coupled with absolute transparency greatly reduces risk. Domains are truly accountable

            Data is a simple yet complex aspect of businesses today. Businesses are often challenged with issues such as
            real-time access to data across their enterprise (some on-prem and some in a multi-cloud environment),
            application services not able to query the right data for analytical needs, the high costs of creating a
            centralized data lake, and the dilution in ownership of data.

                <p class="para-style">
                    A data mesh can transform the way your business works with data. Instead of disparate data sources,
                    a data mesh unifies these data sources to streamline access, governance, security, and querying.

                <p class="para-style">
                    Implementing and managing a data mesh framework is no easy task, which is why NGTIQ created Extrica.

                <p class="para-style">
                    Extrica is a cloud-native, domain-oriented data mesh solution that allows businesses to have a
                    conversation with all data, in any location, and with greater security and reliability. Now you can
                    bridge a community by connecting those who want to share data with those that want to use data.

        <p class="para-style">
            A core tenet of the solution is federated data ownership, where Extrica supports the creation of a data
            community. Here, technical and non-technical users alike can create and share data products to uncover
            hidden opportunities and insights contained within the myriad data points across the enterprise. This
            involves data producers who own and share data, as well as data consumers who use this data in their
            day-to-day workflows.
